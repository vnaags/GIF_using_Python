Imageio is a Python library that provides an easy interface to read and write a wide range of image data. It runs on Python 3.5 and above.Next, I imported it into VS Code Editor.
I then saved two png files of the SAME SIZE in the same folder where i created the python file.
Next I created a list that contains the locations of the image files.I also created an empty list that will be used to store the actual image data from these files.
Then, I used a for loop to go through the file paths and read the images using imageio libraryâ€™s .imread() method.
The .imread() method loads an image based on the file path. So now, the images variable has all the images!
Lastly, I used the .imwrite() method to turn the images into a GIF.
The resultant gif appears in the same folder as the coded file !
